# Local setup

For testing
- npm run test

# Details
- CRA as boilerplate
- All functional requirements have been satisfied
- I was not so familiar with google spreadsheet, so I found a way how to load data
in appropriate format and did all filtering and sorting on client side
- Since my old experience withTS React projects (last projects were mostly react), I decided to save time during test task by not using TS
- Design and responsive part are done. tested desktop devices look as expected.
- Code Linter used from CRA
- Styling tool: styled-components
- As loader used "axios-progress-bar" (google like loader)
- Refresh data each 60s with current month
- Iâ€™ve added a few tests to cover few components. To cover all components - it will take more time
